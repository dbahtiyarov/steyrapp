/*
TO-DO: 
This is a minor page available under "Store" tab

It opens up when user selects the product listed in Store
It shows up clickable gallery of the product's photo, its
description, options, price, rating and comments. 

In Cupertino Navigation Bar you can see the Product name, 
Back Chevron (the "<") and in Trailing we need a "Favourite" 
button marked as "Cupertino Icon Star"

Page should be able to save/load into SQlite as cache, as well 
as retrieve data from Firebase in accordance to the product clicked.
Until data is loaded, page should use placeholders + already known data
(product's main picture and name)

Product should be shareable as a link to the Steyrbach Store online,
as well as it's pictures with Steyrbach watermark on them.

For certified Steyrbach parts, such as official bumpers, mirrors, etc 
the additional button "I wanna sell this" should be available,
in case if user owns the car with this part and wishes to sell it as
used/salvage/refurbished one.
